# Palomar Lab
We are interested on the study of chloroplast chromatin dynamics by using a mix of wet and dry lab methodologies. Our main tools are based on next generation sequencing and bioinformatic data analysis.

## Highlights

Our was established on August 1st, 2023. We are currently recruiting motivated people interested in plant genomics, please browse our Contact page for more information.

We are interested in investigating how the chloroplast genome is organized in nucleoids. Our aim is to understand this organization from an evolutionary perspective, and apply this understanding for the design of more efficient chloroplast genomes. Besides that, oue research has potential to be applied in efforts to increase plant productivity.

Currently, our projects are based on two different avenues: 1) Understanding the chloroplast genome organization in the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, and compare with our current models of land plant chloroplast nucleoids. 2) Analyze the effects of a highly efficient transcription process on the chloroplast DNA topology.
