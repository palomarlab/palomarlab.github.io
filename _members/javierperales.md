Native to Los Cabos, Mexico, Javier enjoys working in science to explore the systems and processes that constitute life. He currently is an undergraduate student at the School of Chemistry, UNAM with a major in chemical pharmacobiology, and works in Dr. Miguel Palomar's lab. Outside the lab he likes to travel and explore the world, and to practice exciting sports. But above all of this, he likes to drink the coffee provided by Miguel in the lab.
