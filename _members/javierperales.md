Native to Los Cabos, Mexico, Javier enjoys doing science especially to explore the systems and processes that constitute life. He currently studies at the School of Chemistry, UNAM and works in Dr. Miguel Palomar's lab. Outside the lab he likes to travel and explore the world, and to practice exciting sports. But above all of this, he likes to drink the coffee provided by Miguel in the lab.
